                            The Search API helps you search for the specific item you want to find. For
                            example, you can find a user or a specific file in a repository. Think of it
                            the way you think of performing a search on Google. It's designed to help
                            you find the one result you're looking for (or maybe the few results you're
                            looking for). Just like searching on Google, you sometimes want to see a few
                            pages of search results so that you can find the item that best meets your
                            needs. To satisfy that need, the GitHub Search API provides up to 1,000
                            results for each search. You can narrow your search using queries. To learn
                            more about the search query syntax, see "Constructing a search query."
